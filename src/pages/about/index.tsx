          Deep in &quot;The heart of India&quot; (i.e.Madhya Pradesh), about 560 KM. away from Delhi by train and road,
          lie the great grand temples of Khajuraho, reputed for their art and architecture and generally admitted as the
          most vibrantly original works of Hindu-architecture. A large city and the capital seat of the Chandellas (a
          medieval central Indian Dynasty), only a thousand year&apos;s ago Khajuraho has now dwindled to a small town,
          accomodating hardly a few thousand souls. Its scenic ruins however, are spread over twelve kms.

          Situated in the heart of Chhatarpur District of Madhya-Pradesh, Khajuraho is respectively 125 kilometers, 55
          kms., and 40 kms. east of Jhansi, Harpalpur and Chhatarpur and 120 kms. south of Mahoba. The
          Yasovarman-Bus-Stand of Khajuraho is located, some where in the middle of the Western group of temples,
          comprising of Shiva and Vaisnav temples and the Eastern group comprising mainly Jain temples. The prominent
          temples of the Western group are those of the Chaunsat-Yogini, the Kandaria-Mahadeo (a corrupt form of
          Kandarp-ari), the Devi Jagadamba, the Chitra-Gupta (The Sun Temple), the Viswanath, the Nandi and the
          Matangeshwar; whereas the prominent temples of the Eastern group are the Parasvanath, the Adinath, the
          Santinath, the Ghantai, the Brahma, the Vaman and the Javari. The Southern group, not as exquisite as the
          Western and Eastern, consists mainly of the Dulhadeva and the Chaturbhuj temples, and is somewhat away from
          the Bus-stand. There are two museums - one that of government, near the Western-group. and the other that of
          Shri Digambar-Jain Atisaya-Kshetra Khajuraho Prabandh Samiti, named as &quot;Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain
          Kala-Sangrahalaya&quot;, located in the precincts of Jain temples of Eastern group.

          The Jain temples of Khajuraho, which constitute the main and important part of the Eastern group of temples
          are near village Khajuraho, at a distance of about one kilometer east of Yasovarman Bus-stand. These temples
          have been well connected by a metalled road. There are enough facilities for the visitors/pilgrims to stay
          within the precincts of Jain temples. There are well furnished Dharamshalas including &quot;Pahil
          Niketan&quot; having sufficient number of room equipped with all the modern facilities, including electricity
          and telephones; and having attached toilets and bath rooms. All visitors can stay here at very nominal
          expenses. The Management supplies the utensils, fuel-wood, beddings and all the necessary articles, on demand.
          The staff members try to let the visitors feel as homely as possible. The atmosphere here is calm and quiet.

          The excellence and magnificence of the architecture and sculptures of the clusters of temples at Khajuraho has
          qualified Khajuraho to be included in the list of important centres of world heritage and Unesco has very
          correctly recognised to be same. This recognision has helped Khajuraho in fast developing as an International
          Tourist Centre yielding much needed foreign exchange and joining it with the world as a whole. This year this
          important tourist centre is busy with its celebrations of Khajuraho millenium which were duly inaugrated by
          His Excellency, the President of India Shri K.R. Narayanan on 6th March 1999. The message of Khajuraho
          millenium is to be worthy of Khajuraho, right to the occasion and be equal to the task.
