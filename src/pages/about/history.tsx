          Khajuraho is in Bundelkhand, which in ancient days was called Chedi-Desa and Jejakabhukti in medieval times.
          The glorious Chandella rulers ruled over this area for about five hundred years (9th to 13th Cen. A.D.) with
          Khajuraho, as one of their Capitals. This place remained the centre of the cultural and religious activities
          of these Chandella rulers for a very long period. The famous temples of Khajuraho, whose art and sculpture,
          irrespective of the fact that it is one thousand years old, have attained world fame, were constructed during
          this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, as the saying goes, eighty four temples were constructed in between 9th and 12th centuries of Vikram
          Era. Many of them were destroyed or mutilated by the invaders, belonging to alien religions. Only thirty of
          them have survived.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temples of Khajuraho are, for the sake of convenience generally divided into three groups. Of them, the
          western group consist of Hindu temples such as those of Chaunsath Yogini, Kandaria Mahadeo, Devi Jagdamba,
          Chitragupta, Viswanath, Matangeshwar, Varaha and Nandi temples; the southern group consist of the Dulhadeo and
          Chaturbhuj tem-ples; and the eastern group consist of all the Jain temples namely Parswanath, Adinath,
          Shantinath, Ghantai etc. plus the Hindu temples of Javari, Vaman and Hanuman. Almost all these temples are
          built of buff-coloured sand-stone, found nearby and each one stands on a solid high masonry terrace with the
          usual wall-enclosure missing. These temples, besides the beauty of outline, apparent at first glance have
          surface decorations that are really marvellous.
        </p>
        <p>
          The harmonious integration of sculptures and architecture as well as the sculptural efflorence and the
          architectural splendour, which is profusely found in these temples, incessantly sing the glories of the great
          builders thereof, who were undoubtedly great connoisseurs of arts and letter during the great renaissance,
          Khajuraho became the centre of a new imagery, some times grotesque, some times subline, now mas-sive, now
          delicate-a synthesis of an art, vital and alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Herein Khajuraho, are found Shaiva, Vaishnava and Jain temples, all of whom may be conveniently divided into
          three groups namely western, eastern and southern.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eastern group of temples is situated near the village Khajuraho. It consists of many old temples, within a
          large though newly constructed compound-wall, comprising Jain temples, besides a few others, situated in the
          vicinity thereof. Of all these temples, the temple of Parsvanath is the biggest and the best. This temple
          occupies important position not only in this group but also in all other groups of temples. Besides this
          temple, Adinath temple (12th Cen (A.D.)) is also standing there, bearing testimony of the beauty and glory,
          which Khajuraho once was. Outside the compound wall, at a short distance from here, there stands a third Jain
          temple, commonly known as Ghantai temple, which is at present much dilapi-dated. But even in this dilapidated
          state, it looks excellent. Al-though, it is not exactly possible to say positively, with the help of the
          material available for the present, as to how many temples of this group have been destroyed; yet in view of
          the large number of mutilated statues or parts thereof as well as the large quantity of other available
          material, relating to the tem-ples, it appears that the number of temples of this group, that existed in those
          old days, must not have been less than twenty four in any case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be it remembered that it is with the help of the ruins of these old temples, that many temples were
          re-constructed, some two or three hundred years ago. Of these reconstructed tem-ples, the Shantinath temple is
          most prominent. It is in this temple that one finds the most enchanting 14 feet high life-size idol of lord
          Santinath. In addition to Jain temples there is a beautiful museum wherein more than hundred mutilated Jain
          sculptures have been artistically exhibited. Further more a number of rarely found Jain images have been
          shifted from this place to the Government museum of Khajuraho and they are being exhibited there.
